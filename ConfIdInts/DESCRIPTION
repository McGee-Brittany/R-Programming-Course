Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    If you have an excel data sheet with values that you hope to find a 
confidence interval for, this package will easily do that for you. For each set
of data it will return the mean, standard error, t-score, margin of error and 
confidence intervals back to you. Also has a function included to plot the 
distribution of your given data points.
